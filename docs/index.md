## About
Network Measurement 4 All (NM4All) was designed after a group of researchers spent time in Northern New Mexico collecting measurements of cellular network performance and availability in the region. They found strong allyship and support in the people living in the area and received many questions about how citizens could go about collecting their own measurements to share with others in their community and to advocate for network resources. The NM4All curriculum is designed to educate a wide range of learners in a variety of settings, including K-12 classrooms, after school programs, community workshops, and college courses. The intended learning outcomes of the curriculum include:


Efforts for the development of NM4All was funded by the NSF project "SCC: PuebloConnect: Expanding Internet Access and Content Relevance in Tribal Communities." The project seeks to address the dual goals of improving Internet access in economically marginalized communities while also building local capacity towards regular digital content creation.
